Minesweeper in JavaScript
=========================
- Creating a minesweeper in Javascript
- Extending it to include an optimal move helper based on own algorithms

This repository is a work in progress

Next steps:

square has reveal method
-> square.reveal()
    -> return content.reveal()

content is either Mine or Blank. both have a reveal method

Explosion and MineCounter inherit from revealed square
 -> return self when revealed
